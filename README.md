<h2>Description</h2>
  This project is a spotify clone, built using react.js, and using spotify API. This project isn't mine, it's just a copy from Kishan Sheth (https://github.com/koolkishan).


<h2>Thoughts through the project</h2>

  This is my first project using React.js and an API, I'm really glad that I started this project, even though I didn't create by myself. Really liked to work on this project, helped me understand more about react and get to know API. 
    I took a long break from my studies, since I was feeling lost, doing a lot of courses, learning a lot of technologies and geting nowhere. 
Because I wasn't practicing I felt discouraged, I wasn't feeling confident about my skills. So I decide to come back for my studies practicing, even if I would "copy" someone project until I felt confident abou my knowledge. This project helped me a lot, I worked with things I've never seen before and still understood, for example Reactjs. Beside that, I didn't catch quite well the API, but i felt more encouraged to studie about.
Decide to change little things, like the volume control, maybe someday I'll style, changing the layout, but I think I developed my skills as I wanted in this project.
  
This is my thoughts through this project, fell free to give an advice, and enjoy it. ðŸ˜Š
